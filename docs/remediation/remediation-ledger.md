# Remediation Ledger

This ledger tracks remediation of the findings in the [2026-08-01 Codex/VS Code static audit](../audits/codex-vscode-static-audit-2026-08-01.md).

## Locked baseline

- Baseline branch: `main`
- Baseline commit: `1797097d8a1c5ab5444ac82e83786ac1ccc841f6`
- Remediation branch: `remediation/wave-01a-safe-read-hash`
- Baseline production-code drift: none
- Initial worktree exception: the audit report was present as an untracked file
- Local verification host: Windows PowerShell 5.1 on Windows 10
- Network access and dependency installation: not authorized and not used

## Work-package state

| Work package | Findings | State | Dependencies | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wave 0: baseline and ledgers | All | Implemented | None | HEAD, instructions, worktree and classifications are recorded |
| WP-01A: safe read/hash foundation | H-03 | Implemented and locally verified | Wave 0 | Contained reads succeed; linked terminal objects and ancestors fail with stable `SAFEFS_*` codes; loop evidence uses the shared primitives |
| WP-01B: mount/device boundaries | H-03 | Not started | WP-01A, Unix fixtures | Unix mount and bind-mount escapes fail closed |
| WP-01C: handle-bound mutation | H-03 | Not started | WP-01A, host capability contract | Supported hosts use no-follow/handle-bound mutation; unsupported hosts fail closed or state the reduced guarantee |
| WP-02: transaction recovery | H-02, M-05 | Not started | WP-01 | Tampered journals and repeated recovery attempts fail safely and deterministically |
| WP-03: canonical plan binding | H-01 | Not started | Canonical serialization | Apply rejects every plan, source, target, option and approval mismatch before mutation |
| WP-04: continuous ownership | H-04 | Not started | WP-03 | Contract reduction retains retired ownership evidence |
| WP-05: transactional uninstall | H-04, M-04 | Not started | WP-01 through WP-04 | Bound preview/apply uninstall is reversible, resumable and idempotent |
| WP-06: memory modes | H-05 | Not started | WP-04, WP-05 | `off` creates and retains no memory artifacts or references |
| WP-07 through WP-10: governance, privacy, prompt trust and evidence trust | H-06 through H-09, M-07, M-08 | Not started | Trust-model ADR, WP-03, WP-08 foundations | Host and artifact trust claims have executable negative evidence and explicit external boundaries |
| WP-11 through WP-16: analyzer, portability, skills, diagnostics, CI and claim governance | M-01 through M-08, L-01 | Not started | Relevant P0 foundations | Each claim has supported-host evidence or an explicitly narrowed scope |

## WP-01A implementation record

Approved file boundary:

- `scripts/Lizard.SafeFs.psm1`
- `scripts/Lizard.LoopEvidence.psm1`
- `scripts/loop-verify.ps1`
- `tests/unit/safe-fs.tests.ps1`
- `tests/adversarial/loop-evidence.tests.ps1`
- `docs/safety-model.md`
- `docs/compatibility.md`
- `docs/remediation/remediation-ledger.md`
- `docs/remediation/claim-ledger.md`
- `changes/safe-read-hash-foundation.json` (separately approved contract-governance scope extension)

Implemented controls:

- Protected existing-file resolution under an explicit authorized root.
- Linked terminal-object and linked-ancestor rejection.
- Stable missing-file, wrong-type, reparse-point and changed-during-read error codes.
- Safe metadata, SHA-256 and content primitives.
- Pre/post read metadata comparison to detect observable changes during a read.
- Protected hashing for Git-reported untracked files.
- Protected verifier evidence metadata and hashing.

Residual limitations:

- The operations remain name-based and cannot eliminate every synchronized ancestor-swap race.
- Mount and bind-mount boundaries are not yet detected on Unix.
- Pre/post length and timestamp comparison is a detection measure, not an authenticated file identity.
- Current evidence is local Windows PowerShell 5.1 evidence; Unix and PowerShell 7 evidence remain pending.

## Verification record

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Failure-first safe-filesystem unit test | Failed as expected because `Get-SafeFileMetadata` did not exist |
| Safe-filesystem unit test after implementation | Passed |
| Adversarial linked-evidence and loop-evidence suite | Passed |
| Focused safety suites | Passed in the final consolidated CI run; all 14 constituent suites also passed during failure isolation |
| Schema validation and mutation suite | Passed: 52/52 bindings and 20/20 mutation cases |
| Contract governance | Passed with `changes/safe-read-hash-foundation.json`; ADR-0002 and ADR-0008 are linked with backward-compatible migration and additive compatibility dispositions |
| Final schema validation and mutation suite | Passed: 53/53 bindings and 20/20 mutation cases after adding the declaration |
| Full local CI | Passed in 1,225 seconds: validation, schema mutations, contract governance, focused safety, packs, drift, quality, smoke, and 18/18 profile/harness matrix combinations |
